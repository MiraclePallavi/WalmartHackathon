**TwinCart** is a smarter, more personal shopping assistant designed for people who don’t just shop for themselves — but also for friends, family, partners, or anyone they care about.

With TwinCart, users can create “twin” profiles of the people they shop for regularly, and receive AI-powered, personalized product recommendations tailored to each twin’s preferences.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User signs in** and creates twins (people they shop for).
2. **Each twin** has a profile capturing style, vibe, hobbies, budget, etc.
3. When shopping, the user selects a twin.
4. TwinCart’s backend:
   - Embeds the twin's profile using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
   - Embeds product descriptions and tags
   - Calculates match scores using:
     - 50% semantic similarity
     - 20% style vibe alignment
     - 30% interest/tag overlap
   - Filters out already purchased products
5. **Curated recommendations** are served to the frontend for a seamless experience.
